    <h1>Healthy lifestyle</h1>
    
    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
    <p>Maintaining healthy nutrition habits is essential for overall well-being and long-term health. 
        A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats provides 
        the necessary nutrients that support bodily functions and boost the immune system. 
        It’s important to eat a variety of foods to ensure you’re getting all the essential vitamins 
        and minerals, while also managing portion sizes and avoiding excessive processed foods, sugar, 
        and unhealthy fats. Hydration is equally important, so drinking plenty of water throughout the 
        day supports metabolism, digestion, and overall bodily functions.</p>

    <h2>Exercise</h2>
    <p>Regular physical activity is crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, improving cardiovascular health, 
        increasing strength, and enhancing mental well-being. A balanced exercise routine that includes 
        aerobic exercises (such as walking, running, or cycling), strength training, and flexibility exercises 
        ensures a well-rounded fitness regimen. Consistency is key, so aiming for at least 30 minutes of moderate 
        activity most days of the week can improve energy levels, reduce stress, and help prevent chronic diseases. 
        Additionally, rest and recovery are important aspects of any exercise routine to prevent overtraining and 
        promote muscle repair.</p>

    <h2>Sleep</h2>
    <p>Good quality sleep is fundamental for physical health, mental clarity, and emotional well-being. 
        To promote healthy sleep habits, it's essential to establish a consistent sleep schedule by going to 
        bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Creating a calming bedtime routine, 
        such as limiting screen time before bed, reducing caffeine intake, and ensuring your sleep environment 
        is comfortable and dark, can help prepare your body for restful sleep. Adults should aim for 7-9 hours 
        of sleep each night to allow for proper recovery and to maintain optimal cognitive and physical functioning.</p>
